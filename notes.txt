This is a rough example of doing a global regex on any communication coming through a Slack server.
It will capture any messages, even private, and run the regex. If it finds any matches, it will append the link to the message.

Requirements:
1. Python 3.5
2. python-slackclient - http://python-slackclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest

Install:
1. pip install slackclient
2. Create a token.txt file with your slack client token in it.

Run:
1. python main.py
